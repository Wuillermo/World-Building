<p align="center"><h1 align="center">World Building Simulator</h1>

<p align="center">
    This is a turn-based strategy game that tries to mimic the evolution of a real world and the relationships between
    different countries and factions as the world evolves around them. The intention is to create a deep simulation but 
    without losing the fun of the game.
